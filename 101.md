# SimplePlugin and StakingModule ERC20 Tokens with fee on transfer are not supported

## Summary
SimplePlugin and StakingModule ERC20 Tokens with fee on transfer are not supported
## Vulnerability Detail
There are ERC20 tokens that charge fee for every `transfer()` / `transferFrom()`.

## Impact
`claim` and `_exit` functions assumes that the received amount is the same as the transfer amount, and returns it, while the actual transferred amount can be lower for those tokens.

## Recommendation
