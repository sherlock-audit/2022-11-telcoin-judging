# `approve(<SPENDER>, 0)` before `approve(<SPENDER>, <AMOUNT>)`

## Summary

It is recommended reducing the spender `allowance` to zero before each make an `approve(<SPENDER>, <AMOUNT>)` call

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function [`submit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L47-L82) the parameter `token` could be USDT for example who need reducing the spender `allowance` to zero, look approve of [L72](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L72)
Another case would be that the behavior of [`_telcoin`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L23) was like that of USDT, look approve of [L63](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L63) and [L79](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L79)

## Impact

Some tokens, like USDT, require first reducing the spender `allowance` to zero, otherwise the transaction will revert

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol

/// @audit: Only if ERC20 `_telcoin` is known can this be avoided, and should not be exchanged for another token
63      _telcoin.approve(address(_referral), _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this)));

72      IERC20(token).approve(_aggregator, amount);

/// @audit: Only if ERC20 `_telcoin` is known can this be avoided, and should not be exchanged for another token
79    _telcoin.approve(address(_referral), _telcoin.balanceOf(address(this)));
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `approve(<SPENDER>, 0)` to set the allowance to zero immediately before each of the existing `approve(<SPENDER>, <AMOUNT>)` call
