# FeeBuyback.submit doesn't check if they received fee from wallet's swap

## Summary
FeeBuyback.submit doesn't check if they received fee from wallet's swap
## Vulnerability Detail
FeeBuyback.submit function firstly make wallet's swap and supposes that after that swap some fee will be transfered to safe address. Then the provided amount is transferred from safe to FeeBuyback. After that 1inch swap is called that should swap all sent funds from safe to FeeBuyback to TEL token. And after that TEL is sent to plugin.

But this function doesn't check that the safe indeed received that fee amount after initial swap. If safe holds another funds, then in case when fee is not paid the funds controlled by safe will be used to send to plugin.
## Impact
Fee is not received and safe's funds are used to send to plugin.
