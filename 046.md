# `slash()` can be used to withdraw funds even when protocol is in a paused state

## Summary
`pause()` is used during an emergency situation, and presumably this should stop all transfer of assets of protocol while the situation is figured out. However, users with the `PAUSER_ROLE` can bypass this by calling `slash()` to withdraw their own or assets of others.

## Vulnerability Detail
`slash()` is lacking any sort of `pause` related modifier to it. It can be called regardless of whether the protocol is in a paused state. I understand that `claimAndExitFor()` and `stakeFor()` can also be used to move assets around but these are utilised only during token migration and only allowed by the `RECOVERY_ROLE`.

## Impact
Assets that are supposed to be frozen during the paused state can still be moved around by `PAUSER_ROLE`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend adding the `whenNotPaused` modifier to `slash()`.
