# ``_notifyStakeChangeAllPlugins`` call can DOS the protocol

## Summary
In case one of the used ``IPlugin`` contract reverts inside ``_notifyStakeChangeAllPlugins`` all main ``StableModule`` functions will also revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

``_notifyStakeChangeAllPlugins`` is used internally to notify all registered plugins when a account stake changes. This is done with the following for loop:

A ``IPlugin`` can signal his intention to be notified by returning ``true`` from the function ``requiresNotification()``

## Impact
Inside the previously mentioned for loop this signal is ignored (commented out) so in a event a plugin chooses to ignore stakes changes callback by returning false in ``requiresNotification()`` and by reverting in the callback ``notifyStakeChange`` all main protocol functionality are denied.

## Recommendation
Uncomment the line

or use try...catch to prevent misbehaving plugins from DOS-ing the protocol.
