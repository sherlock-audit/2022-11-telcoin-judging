# The status of plugins are not checked, like already self-destructed

## Summary
The status of plugins is not checked. For example, if a plugin is destroyed by calling `selfdestruct`, then it will cause two consequences: 
1.  Many functions won't work, i.e., some places poll plugins in for loop;
2.  Users' claimable fund may be swept away.

## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose Bob writes a plugin with the intention of rug pull:
1.  Bob implements the plugin by hiding `selfdestruct` in modified openzeppelin or solmate library, and does not upload source codes to blockchain explorer;
2.  Bob appliies to add this plugin, and let it running normal for a period of time;
3.  When enough funds accumulated, Bob calls `selfdestruct` to destroy the plugin to sweep funds and many functions in `StakingModule.sol` won't able to work, calling for the plugin editor to manually remove Bob's plugin.

If a plugin is already self-destructed, many places in `StakingModule.sol` would be affected.
- like `totalSupply`, its execution would be reverted. Or since funds are transferred through `selfdestruct`,  the total supply would be calculated wrong.

## Impact
The status of plugins is not checked with two consequence: (1) Many functions won't work, and (2) Users' claimable fund may be swept away.

## Code Snippet
The places call `IPlugin` in `StakingModule.sol`:

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To check the status of plugins with handling codes of `selfdestruct`
