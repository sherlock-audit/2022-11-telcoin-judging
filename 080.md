# `FeeBuyback` native token can not be rescued

## Summary

Lack of methods to rescue native tokens trapped in the `FeeBuyback` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Like ERC20 tokens, the native token may also get stuck in the `FeeBuyback` contract for all sorts of reasons.

For example, at L77, the `_aggregator` is called with a `msg.value`, which means that the native token can be used as an inToken for the swap. Therefore, part of the input native token can be sent back to the FeeBuyback contract as a leftover.

However, the current implementation of `rescueERC20()` only supports rescue ERC20 tokens.

## Impact

The leftover native tokens trapped in the contract can not be rescued.
