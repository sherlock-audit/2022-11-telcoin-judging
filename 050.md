# removePlugin function should be validated

## Summary
If you try to remove wrong or non-existent index this function won't work properly.

## Vulnerability Detail
Non exitent index will return 0. There must be validation for plugins[index] otherwise this code will run and continue to decrease nPlugins. Which cause totalSupply to be not correct. Which will cause total claimable to be wrong.

## Impact
nPlugins can go to - and this will cause to totalSupply to be uncaltulated.
