# Earned yield should be claimed on removal of a plugin

## Summary
The code in `StakingModule` allows for the removal of plugins but if there was any earned yield for users it won't be possible for them to claim it

## Vulnerability Detail
The `removePlugin` method in `StakingModule` does not actually claim yield for stakers, so if they didn't call `claim` before the `PLUGIN_EDITOR` removes a plugin they will lose their accrued yield.

## Impact
Users can lose on accrued yield because of plugin removal, essentially a loss of value.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a separate functionality for users to be able to claim rewards from removed plugins.
