# Deflationary tokens are not supported

## Summary
There are ERC20 tokens that may make certain customizations to their ERC20 contracts. One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a certain fee for every transfer() or transferFrom().

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Deflationary tokens are not supported

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L95

       'IERC20(externalToken).transfer(account, amount);'

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L62

           '_telcoin.transferFrom(_safe, address(this), amount);'
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L71

            'IERC20(token).transferFrom(_safe, address(this), amount);'

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One possible mitigation is to measure the asset change right before and after the asset-transferring functions.
