# Lack of sanity checks for new plugin address in addPlugin()

## Summary
Without sanity checks for new plugin address in addPlugin(), wrong address can be added which will revert claim functionality.
## Vulnerability Detail
When adding a new plugin, there are no sanity checks for the new plugin's address.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/StakingModule.sol#L409-L417
```solidity
    function addPlugin(address plugin) external onlyRole(PLUGIN_EDITOR_ROLE) {
        require(!pluginsMapping[plugin], "StakingModule::addPlugin: Cannot add an existing plugin");


        plugins.push(plugin);
        pluginsMapping[plugin] = true;
        nPlugins++;


        emit PluginAdded(plugin, nPlugins);
    }
```

However, adding a wrong address can cause claim functionality to not work as 1 not working plugin will block claim for all plugins.
## Impact
Wrong address can be added which will revert claim functionality

## Recommendation
Check that `plugin.staking == address(this)`.
