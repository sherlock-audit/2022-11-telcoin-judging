# Lack of sanity checks for new plugin address in addPlugin / duplicated and invalid plugin address allowed

## Summary

Without sanity checks for new plugin address in addPlugin(), wrong address or duplicated address can be added.

## Vulnerability Detail

When adding a new plugin, there are no sanity checks for the new plugin's address.

However, adding a wrong address or duplicated address can cause severe damage to the users, and it may be irreversible:

## Impact

When a wrong address is added as a plugin, many essential features of the StakingModule contract will malfunction,

The calculation of totalSupply and claimable reward are wrong and user are not able to unstake and claim reward properly because the wrongly added address block the stake / unstake and reward flow.

When an existing plugin is wrongfully added as a new plugin, the totalSupply() will double count the balance of that plugin and the reward of the plugin will be  double counted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add check to make sure the duplicate plugin is not allowed and add check to ensure the _plugin.stakingModule == address(this) which will first ensure the plugin address is a valid contract
