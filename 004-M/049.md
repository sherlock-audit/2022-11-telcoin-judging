# proper validation should be done on addPlugin function

## Summary
Without validation for new plugin address in addPlugin(), wrong address can be added.

## Vulnerability Detail
When adding new plugin, there is no validation for the address besides the existing plugin check.

## Impact
Adding correct plugin is quite essential for this contract. Without proper validations this contract wouldn't work correctly. Even for existing plugins adding it with wrong address as a new plugin will cause error on supply etc.
