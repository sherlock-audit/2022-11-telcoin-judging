# `claimFromIndividualPlugin()` may endup claiming the reward from a different plugin with wrong `auxData` when the index as changed due to `removePlugin()`

## Summary

When `removePlugin()` happens between the user sends the `claimFromIndividualPlugin()` transaction and before it gets minted, it may lead to lesser rewards as the `auxData` prepared for another plugin will now be used.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user calls `claimFromIndividualPlugin()`, a `pluginIndex` is used to refer to a plugin.

However, if the `PLUGIN_EDITOR` removed a plugin before the transaction gets minted, the plugin referred by the `pluginIndex` can be changed to another plugin.

As a result, the `auxData` supposed to be supplied to the original plugin is now supplied to another plugin.

## Impact

The user may end up with lesser rewards as a wrong `auxData` is supplied to the wrong plugin.
