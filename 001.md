# When one of the plugins is broken or paused, it will be not possible to claim any else plugin

## Summary
When one of the plugins is broken or paused, it will be not possible to claim any else plugin as claim is going through the plugins loop.
## Vulnerability Detail
A given plugin can temporally or even permanently becomes malfunctioning.
In such case it will not be possible for users to claim any else plugin as claiming is going through the loop.

```solidity
    function _claim(address account, address to, bytes calldata auxData) private returns (uint256) {
        // balance of `to` before claiming
        uint256 balBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(tel).balanceOf(to);


        // call claim on all plugins and count the total amount claimed
        uint256 total;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < nPlugins; i++) {
            total += IPlugin(plugins[i]).claim(account, to, auxData);
        }


        // make sure `total` actually matches how much we've claimed
        require(IERC20Upgradeable(tel).balanceOf(to) - balBefore == total, "one or more plugins did not send appropriate token amount");


        // only emit Claimed if anything was actually claimed
        if (total > 0) {
            emit Claimed(account, total);
        }


        return total;
    }
