# Telcoin token address can become stale

## Summary
In an event of upgrading the ``StakingModule`` contract address used for ``Telcoin`` token operations can become stale.

## Vulnerability Detail

``StakingModule`` upgrade can change the address used for the ``Telcoin`` token by the ``initializer``

Inside ``SimplePlugin`` and ``FeeBuyback`` contract this address is fixed in the constructor.

## Impact

Using stale address is never a good best practice.
The **main problem** is that just redeploying the problematic contracts is not the easiest solution in case when we have already accumulated user claims. In this case a ``migration`` is needed which as stated in the comments is not a cheap operation doing it for every user account.

Also the solution proposed is for the migration of the ``StakingModule`` contract and not the mentioned ones.

## Recommendation
The easiest solution would be to get the correct address trough the ``StakingModule`` contract before any token operation like is done in this line:
