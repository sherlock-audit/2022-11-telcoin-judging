# Plugin removals causes loss of unclaimed yields

## Summary
There is no recovery for unclaimed yields when a plugin is removed.

## Vulnerability Detail
Plugins (responsible for accruing/generating yield for stakers) can be added or removed. The `SimplePlugin` is the only plugin at the moment, and has a very simple design of accrediting yield to individuals. 

This plugin has a `rescueTokens()` function, but isn't able to touch anything that is meant for users.
```solidity
function rescueTokens(IERC20 token, address to) external onlyOwner {
        if (token == tel) {
            // if the token is TEL, only send the extra amount. Do not send anything that is meant for users.
            token.safeTransfer(to, token.balanceOf(address(this)) - _totalOwed);
```

Upon its removal (perhaps upgrading to a better plugin) from the `StakingModule`, there is no way for the yield to be recovered unless it is added back.  Hence, any unclaimed yield can be considered to be lost.

## Impact
Loss of unclaimed yields.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Yearn V1 has a `withdrawAll()` function for strategy migration. Something similar would be good to have here. Perhaps a `withdrawAll()` function that can only be called by the staking module upon plugin removal to pull any unclaimed tel tokens to itself. The recovery function in the staking module is then able to claw back the unclaimed yield and decide how to best distribute it amongst its user base / stakers.

```solidity
/// TODO: called by StakingModule when removing plugin
function withdrawAll() onlyStaking {
    tel.transfer(msg.sender, tel.balanceOf(address(this));
}

// Funds can then be claimed from the StakingModule by calling `rescueTokens()`
```
