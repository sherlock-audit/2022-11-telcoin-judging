# Audit Report

# Codebase Impressions and Summary

Overall, it is a simple codebase enabling TEL staking and accuring yield to TEL stakers. Code coverage was great at about 96.77% line coverage for the core `StakingModule` and `SimplePlugin` contracts. The contracts were well-documented (accompanied by UML diagrams) and had good inline comments.

A number of notable low-severity and informational issues are found and mentioned below. 

# Project Components
The main contract of interest for this audit is the `StakingModule`. It is where the core staking logic resides, allowing users to stake, claim and unstake their TEL coin holdings. 

Plugins are modular components that are responsible for accruing/generating yield for stakers, which the `StakingModule` pulls from. There is only 1 plugin implemented so far: the `SimplePlugin`, which allows a designated (trusted) address to increase the rewards of an individual account by calling `increaseClaimableBy()`.

The `SimplePlugin`'s designated / trusted address is the `FeeBuyback`. This allows a trusted party (`owner`) to perform up to 2 swaps: the first is the user requested swap, then an optional second to swap out the fee token (if it isn't TEL) to TEL. It then forwards and credits the fee as a reward to the referrer for the user performing the swap. 

`TieredOwnership` is a simple access control implementation that is used by `FeeBuyback`: a designated `_executor` is able to add and remove multiple `owner`. The `_executor` can also transfer his power to another executor in a 2-step transfer process.

While `AuxDataLib` is not currently used, it could very well be for future plugins that may require auxiliary data for claiming yield.

## L-01: Pauser should not be able to resume functionality

### Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
/// @notice This role grants the ability to pause all unrestricted external functions in an emergency situation
bytes32 public constant PAUSER_ROLE = keccak256("PAUSER_ROLE");
```

An important concept of cybersecurity is the principle of least privilege: _a user is given the minimum levels of access – or permissions – needed to perform his/her job functions._

The staking module could be paused due to a hack / malicious trusted actor / vulnerability in a plugin. Regardless of whether circumstances are adverse, it is recommended to have the resumption of functionality escalated to a party of higher authority.

### Recommendation
`unpause()` should be performed by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

## L-02: `exit()` should not be pausable

### Vulnerability Detail
Users should not be restricted from pulling out their stakes from the `StakingModule`, and arguably so in emergencies / dure situations. Restricting it to be callable only when the contract is paused can be seen as a rug-pull vector.

### Recommendation
`exit()` should always be callable.

## L-03: Add constructor initializer in `StakingModule`

### Vulnerability Detail
As per [OpenZeppelin’s (OZ) recommendation](hhttps://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#initializing_the_implementation_contract), it is recommended not to leave an implementation contract uninitialized.

### Recommendation
```solidity
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```

## L-04: `StakingModule` notifies regardless of plugin's `requiresNotification()`

### Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/StakingModule.sol#L386-L389

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/SimplePlugin.sol#L102-L106

The `if (IPlugin(plugins[i]).requiresNotification()) {` condition is commented out, meaning that all plugins will be notified regardless of whether the plugin needs it.

### Recommendation
EIther remove the functionality, or update the natspec to reflect the current behaviour.

## L-06: Misleading `claimAndExit()` function name

### Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/StakingModule.sol#L346-L356

`_claimAndExit()` suggests that the stake will be fully withdrawn, but it could be the case that only the yield and / or a partial stake is withdrawn.

### Recommendation
Rename the function to `_claimAndUnstake()` instead.

## L-07: Incorrect / missing natspec

### Vulnerability Detail
Incorrect natspec: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L39

The `submit()` function does not have a pausable modifier, so I'm not sure how it's intended for the function to be paused.

Missing natspec: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L42-L47

The `recipient` param is missing from the natspec.

### Recommendation
- Remove the `@dev function can be paused` comment and add in the `recipient` param description.

## L-08: `safeTransferFrom` should be used in FeeBuyback

### Vulnerability Detail

### Recommendation

## L-09: DoS with too many plugins / gas-intensive claims

### Vulnerability Detail

### Recommendation

## I-01: Lacking stake and claim functionality

### Detail
There are functions that enable claiming and withdrawing (partial and full) in a single step. One can also compound his TEL yield by calling `partialClaimAndExit()` with 0 amount. Oddly, there isn't a function for staking more TEL and compounding yield in a single function call. Would be a nice feature to have.

### Recommendation
Consider adding a `stakeAndClaim()` function that enables users to stake more TEL and compound their yield.

## I-02: Unclear `stakeFor()` use case
