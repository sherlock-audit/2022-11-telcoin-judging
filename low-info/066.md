# Non-sensical use of virtual functions in TieredOwnership

## Summary
Some methods in TieredOwnership allow overriding that could reasonably never be used, therefore the only benefit of the virtual is to allow mistakes to happen and to waste gas.
## Vulnerability Detail
The getters executor() and nominatedExecutor() (that return _executor and _nominatedExecutor respectively) are virtual. But the _executor and _nominatedExecutor are private and the setters for them are not virtual. Therefore a derived class cannot have it's own handling of the executor. Therefore is no conceivable reason for it to want to override the getters.
## Impact
Over-complicated code, possible errors, extra gas for using executor() instead of reading _executor directly.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
* Remove the virtual from executor() and nominatedExecutor()
* Change executor() to _executor within TieredOwnership.
* Or make the setters virtual too. But I can't imagine a reason to do that.
* ... Do the owner methods need to be virtual?
