# Failed transfer with low level call won't revert

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
According to [Solidity Docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions), the call may return true even if it was a failure. This may result in user funds being lost because funds were transferred into this contract in preparation for the swap. The swap fails but doesn't revert.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L75-L77

              '//Perform secondary swap from fee token to TEL
             //do simple transfer from and submit
            (bool swapResult,) = _aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);'


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check for contract existence on low-level calls, so that failures are not missed.
