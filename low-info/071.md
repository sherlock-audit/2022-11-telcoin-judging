# Warning - should submit work without fee?

## Summary
This is just informational as I don't know exactly how 1 inch, or the "owner" of FeeBuyback works.

Is it possible that the owner calls submit without providing the eth for the fee? Perhaps the fee can be rounded to 0 for some very small amounts? What if it is (later becomes) desirable to make swaps w/o a fee?
Is the swap then going to return false because of 0 amount and revert the whole transaction?
