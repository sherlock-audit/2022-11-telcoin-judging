Having an extra storage variable for an array's length - doesn't really save gas and increases a chance of errors.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the nPlugins variable and use plugins.length instead. If the length is used multiple times within a function, then store it in a local variable. Which is still cheaper than maintaining an extra storage var.
