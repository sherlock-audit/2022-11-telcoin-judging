# Unnecessary inaccuracy and wasted gas in FeeBuyback::submit

## Summary
Using total telcoin balance for referral payout instead of amount.
## Vulnerability Detail
We already have the "amount" available right there, so there is no reason to use the total token balance as the transfer amount.
## Impact
* If the token balance increased in one way or another, the given referral will get more than they are supposed to - and there is no reason for that
* Reading the token balance costs gas and it is done 2x in consecution, costing 2x the gas.
* Similar situation is a few lines lower, 79/80. But I understand that here you don't have the amount so it keeps the code simple

Manual Review

## Recommendation
* Simply use amount in the approve and increaseClaimableBy instead of balanceOf().
* If you want to keep it this way, at least store the balance in a var to read it just once and save gas. Also applies to the two lines a bit lower - 79-80,
