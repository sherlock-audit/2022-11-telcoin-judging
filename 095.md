# Use of `transfer()` instead of `call()` to send eth

## Summary
 Use of `transfer()` instead of `call()` to send eth

## Impact

Use of `transfer()` might render ETH impossible to withdraw because after istanbul hardfork, there is increases in the gas cost of the `SLOAD` operation and therefore breaks some existing smart contracts.Those contracts will break because their fallback functions used to consume less than `2300` gas, and they’ll now consume more, since `2300` the amount of gas a contract’s fallback function receives if it’s called via Solidity’s `transfer()` or `send()` methods.

Any smart contract that uses `transfer()` or `send()` is taking a hard dependency on gas costs by forwarding a fixed amount of gas: `2300`.
