# check bytes data length before abi.decode

## Summary

The data length is not checked before abi.decode, which could result in wrong `HeaderItem` array being decoded.

## Vulnerability Detail

`parse()` does not check data length of `data`, if bytes data is provided, `HeaderItem` array could be wrongly decoded, for example packed or unpacked could lead to different decode. And the resultant payload would be wrong.

## Impact

- wrong `HeaderItem` results could be returned as the `header`
- the payload would be wrong for future use.
