# Use `safeTransfer`/`safeTransferFrom` instead of `transfer`/`transferFrom` for ERC20 transfer

## Summary

It is recommended to use `safeTransfer`/`safeTransferFrom` instead of `transfer`/`transferFrom` when transferring ERC20s in **contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol**

## Vulnerability Detail

Tokens not compliant with the ERC20 specification could return `false` from the `safeTransfer`/`safeTransferFrom` function call to indicate the transfer fails, while the calling contract would not notice the failure if the return value is not checked. Checking the return value is a requirement, as written in the [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) specification:
> Callers MUST handle false from returns (bool success). Callers MUST NOT assume that false is never returned!

## Impact

The `safeTransfer`/`safeTransferFrom` can cause silent failures and affect token accounting in the contract

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol

/// @audit: Only if ERC20 `_telcoin` is known can this be avoided, and should not be exchanged for another token
62      _telcoin.transferFrom(_safe, address(this), amount);

71      IERC20(token).transferFrom(_safe, address(this), amount);

95    IERC20(externalToken).transfer(account, amount);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the `SafeERC20` library implementation from OpenZeppelin and call [`safeTransferFrom` and `safeTransfer`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/ecd2ca2cd7cac116f7a37d0e474bbb3d7d5e1c4d/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L30-L37):
