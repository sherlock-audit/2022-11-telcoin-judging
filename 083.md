# Flashloan `TEL` tokens to stake and exit in the same block can fake a huge amount of stake with minimal material cost

## Summary

`Checkpoints#getAtBlock()` can be faked with falshloan as it may return the value of the first checkpoint in the same block.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Checkpoints#getAtBlock()` will return the value on check point #0 when there are two check points in the same block (#0 and #1).

Therefore, one can take a falshloan of TEL tokens to stake and exit in the same block, which will create two checkpoints.

## Impact

Malicious user can fake their stake to gain a high percentage rewards with falshloan and avoid slashing.
