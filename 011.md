# Use `safeTransfer()`/`safeTransferFrom()` instead of `transfer()`/`transferFrom()` for ERC20 transfers.

## Summary
Use safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom() instead of transfer()/transferFrom() for ERC20 transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail
It is recommended to always use safeTransfer when transferring ERC20s. Some ERC20 implementations do not implement a return value such as BNB. This will cause the token to always revert when trying to redeem.

## Impact
It is a good idea to add a require() statement that checks the return value of ERC20 token transfers or to use something like OpenZeppelin’s safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom() unless one is sure the given token reverts in case of a failure. Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in contract.

**However, using require() to check transfer return values could lead to issues with non-compliant ERC20 tokens which do not return a boolean value. Therefore, it’s highly advised to use OpenZeppelin’s safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom()**
