# Audit Report

# Codebase Impressions and Summary

Overall, it is a simple codebase enabling TEL staking and accuring yield to TEL stakers. Code coverage was great at about 96.77% line coverage for the core `StakingModule` and `SimplePlugin` contracts. The contracts were well-documented (accompanied by UML diagrams) and had good inline comments.

A number of notable low-severity and informational issues are found and mentioned below. 

# Project Components
The main contract of interest for this audit is the `StakingModule`. It is where the core staking logic resides, allowing users to stake, claim and unstake their TEL coin holdings. 

Plugins are modular components that are responsible for accruing/generating yield for stakers, which the `StakingModule` pulls from. There is only 1 plugin implemented so far: the `SimplePlugin`, which allows a designated (trusted) address to increase the rewards of an individual account by calling `increaseClaimableBy()`.

The `SimplePlugin`'s designated / trusted address is the `FeeBuyback`. This allows a trusted party (`owner`) to perform up to 2 swaps: the first is the user requested swap, then an optional second to swap out the fee token (if it isn't TEL) to TEL. It then forwards and credits the fee as a reward to the referrer for the user performing the swap. 

`TieredOwnership` is a simple access control implementation that is used by `FeeBuyback`: a designated `_executor` is able to add and remove multiple `owner`. The `_executor` can also transfer his power to another executor in a 2-step transfer process.

While `AuxDataLib` is not currently used, it could very well be for future plugins that may require auxiliary data for claiming yield.

## L-01: Admin Privilege: `owner` has multiple ways to cause harm in `FeeBuyback`

### Vulnerability Detail
The `owner` is given significant privilege in `FeeBuyback` for swaps. Some of the ways the `owner` can cause harm are listed below (not exhaustive).

1) Pull all TEL coins from the [Telcoin Fee Gnosis Safe](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xd796d81170645fdd1efc1c1b1090969b11008d9c#code) for yield allocation to any desired user, assuming unlimited approval is given. They are currently ~5M TEL coins held in the safe at the time of writing.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L61-L66

2) Use latent TEL funds in the `FeeBuyback` contract for yield allocation. While the pulled amount from the safe is specified as `amount`, the actual allocation used for yield allocation is the entire TEL balance held by the  `FeeBuyback` contract. Meaning, any TEL coins (whether intentionally or not) sent directly to the `FeeBuyback` contract may be used. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L62-L64

3) An `owner` may grieve other `owners` of secondary swaps if the fee token used does not allow non-zero to non-zero approvals. Some tokens do not allow the approval to be set from a non-zero value to another non-zero value. If such tokens are used as fee tokens, then should the second swap use only partial allowance set, other `owners` will be unable to execute secondary swaps to TEL tokens because of failed approvals.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L70-L77

### Recommendation
While it is clear that the `owner` has to be a trusted party, there are remediation steps that can be taken to address issues (2) and (3).
(2) - Use `amount` instead of `_telcoin.balanceOf(address(this))`
(3) - Use OZ's `safeIncreaseAllowance`, or ensure that the entire input amount is used for the swap, ie. check that allowance is zero after the swap.

## L-02: `safeTransferFrom` should be used in FeeBuyback

### Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L70-L73
Some tokens may not revert or return false in the `transferFrom()` method; this would enable the `owner` to use any latent funds in the contract for the swap.

### POC
1. `FeeBuyback` has 10 tokens
2. `_safe` has zero balance
3. `amount` specified is 10; `transferFrom()` does not revert / returns false upon calling `transferFrom()`, even though there is insufficient balance
4. `_aggregator.call()` uses the 10 tokens held by the `FeeBuyback` 

### Recommendation
Use OZ's `safeTransferFrom()` instead of `transferFrom()`.

## L-03: Pauser should not be able to resume functionality

### Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
/// @notice This role grants the ability to pause all unrestricted external functions in an emergency situation
bytes32 public constant PAUSER_ROLE = keccak256("PAUSER_ROLE");
```

An important concept of cybersecurity is the principle of least privilege: _a user is given the minimum levels of access – or permissions – needed to perform his/her job functions._

The staking module could be paused due to a hack / malicious trusted actor / vulnerability in a plugin. Regardless of whether circumstances are adverse, it is recommended to have the resumption of functionality escalated to a party of higher authority.

### Recommendation
`unpause()` should be performed by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

## L-04: `exit()` should not be pausable

### Vulnerability Detail
Users should not be restricted from pulling out their stakes from the `StakingModule`, and arguably so in emergencies / dure situations. Restricting it to be callable only when the contract is paused can be seen as a rug-pull vector.

### Recommendation
`exit()` should always be callable.

## L-05: Add constructor initializer in `StakingModule`

### Vulnerability Detail
As per [OpenZeppelin’s (OZ) recommendation](hhttps://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#initializing_the_implementation_contract), it is recommended not to leave an implementation contract uninitialized.

### Recommendation
```solidity
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```

## L-06: `StakingModule` notifies regardless of plugin's `requiresNotification()`

### Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/StakingModule.sol#L386-L389

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/SimplePlugin.sol#L102-L106

The `if (IPlugin(plugins[i]).requiresNotification()) {` condition is commented out, meaning that all plugins will be notified regardless of whether the plugin needs it.

### Recommendation
EIther remove the functionality, or update the natspec to reflect the current behaviour.

## L-07: Misleading `claimAndExit()` function name

### Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/StakingModule.sol#L346-L356

`_claimAndExit()` suggests that the stake will be fully withdrawn, but it could be the case that only the yield and / or a partial stake is withdrawn.

### Recommendation
Rename the function to `_claimAndUnstake()` instead.

## L-08: Incorrect / missing natspec

### Vulnerability Detail
Incorrect natspec: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L39

The `submit()` function does not have a pausable modifier, so I'm not sure how it's intended for the function to be paused.

Missing natspec: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/fee-buyback/FeeBuyback.sol#L42-L47

The `recipient` param is missing from the natspec.

### Recommendation
- Remove the `@dev function can be paused` comment and add in the `recipient` param description.

## I-01: Lacking stake and claim functionality

### Detail
There are functions that enable claiming and withdrawing (partial and full) in a single step. One can also compound his TEL yield by calling `partialClaimAndExit()` with 0 amount. Oddly, there isn't a function for staking more TEL and compounding yield in a single function call. Would be a nice feature to have.

### Recommendation
Consider adding a `stakeAndClaim()` function that enables users to stake more TEL and compound their yield.

## I-02: `staking` and `tel` can be declared immutable

### Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/SimplePlugin.sol#L20-L24

These variables can be made immutable to save deployment and runtime gas costs.

## I-03: Change variable types to avoid unnecessary castings

### Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/StakingModule.sol#L30-L31
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/StakingModule.sol#L34

Declaring `tel` as `IERC20Upgradeable` and `plugins` as `IPlugins[]` would avoid having to cast them to these types throughout the staking module. 

## I-04: Remaining TODO

### Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-telcoin/blob/main/contracts/StakingModule.sol#L12

Not sure if done already. Such TODOs should be checked and removed once completed.

## Small Commentary
As it stands, staking TEL has no tangible effect; there isn't an on-chain requirement for yield to be given only to TEL stakers. I assume that future plugins will distribute yield proportional to the staked amounts of users.
