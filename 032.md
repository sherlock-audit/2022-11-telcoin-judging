# Unbounded loop in StakingModule.sol can consume all gas and revert transaction.

## Summary

Unbounded loop in StakingModule.sol can consume all gas and revert transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current model, the admin can add a new module in StakingModule.sol

However, there is no upper limit for how many new modules is added.

But when calculating the totalSupply and total reward, We are looped through all the staking module.

When claiming the reward, we loops all the staking module to calculate the staking reward, which creates an unbounded loop that can consume all gas.

## Impact

Unbounded loop in StakingModule.sol can consume all gas and revert transaction.

## Recommendation

We recommend the admin add a upper limit for how many module can be added.
