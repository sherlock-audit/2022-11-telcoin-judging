# Slashing fails if claims revert

## Summary
Slashing claims yields for the slashed account as part of the process. Should claims revert, slashing attempts will revert too.

## Vulnerability Detail
Slashing calls the underlying `_claimAndExit()` function, which claims yield from all plugins. Should one or more claims fail, slashing will revert as well.

## Impact
Failing claims brick the slashing functionality until the erroneous plugin(s) are removed. During which, the slashed user could have claimed his yield and exited.

## Recommendation
Create another `slash()` method that skips claiming yields of the slashed account.
